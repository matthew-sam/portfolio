# Projects Descriptions

## Web-Based CRUD Application for SQL Server Data Management
Developed a dynamic web application using Python Flask, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and AJAX to manage SQL Server database data. Enabled users to perform CRUD operations on student information with features for adding, editing, and deleting records. Integrated APIs for efficient CSV file uploads, showcasing proficiency in full-stack development. Currently running locally for development purposes.

## Survey Text Analysis for Training Program Improvements
*Associated with RDAbbott*<br />
Applied NLP techniques with Python libraries NLTK and spaCy to effectively analyze survey data. Produced word cloud visualizations and conducted sentiment analysis, providing actionable insights for training enhancements and targeted programs tailored to employee preferences.

## Price Range Anomaly Detection Using SQL
*Associated with RDAbbott*<br />
Led an initiative to identify and rectify improper price range setups for products through SQL analysis. The challenge involved identifying instances where products had inconsistent pricing structures. Employing advanced SQL techniques, including Common Table Expressions (CTEs), subqueries, and aggregate functions, a series of temporary tables were created to systematically filter and analyze the data. This approach successfully pinpointed products with pricing anomalies, allowing for necessary adjustments and ensuring pricing consistency for improved business operations.Led an initiative to identify and rectify improper price range setups for products through SQL analysis.

## Customer Segmentation Dashboard 
*Associated with RDAbbott*<br />
Created a dynamic Tableau dashboard to categorize silicone manufacturing customers based on their purchasing behavior. Users could explore data using the primary filter generated from a calculated field, date filters, search functionality, and drill-down options. An Excel table used in conjunction with the dashboard helps identify target customers for further investigation based on predefined difference values of certain product classes. This dashboard provided valuable insights for data-driven sales and marketing strategies in the silicone manufacturing industry.

## First Sales Dashboard
*Associated with RDAbbott*<br />
Developed a Tableau dashboard in collaboration with stakeholder company to analyze customer and product first purchases within a specific timeframe. Additionally, the dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key metrics including quantity sold, cost of goods sold (COGS), margin amount, and sales amount . By gathering direct requirements from stakeholders, the dashboard was tailored to meet their needs, facilitating data-driven decisions regarding customer and product strategies. This interactive tool enhances collaboration between both companies, offering actionable insights into first purchase trends and enabling informed business decisions.

## Automating Data Retrieval with Python Scripts in Tableau
*Associated with RDAbbott*<br />
Undertook an ambitious project to seamlessly integrate Python scripts with Tableau, enabling data source enhancement through API calls. The objective was to automate data retrieval and update processes directly within Tableau. The script was designed to pull data sources, isolate specific columns, and batch them into groups of 30 tracking numbers. It further organized these batches into four variables, allowing for concurrent API calls to enhance efficiency. While the project couldn't be finalized due to the unavailability of Tableau Server, it showcased the ability to streamline and automate data workflows.

## Automated Plant Watering System with Weather-Based Adjustments
Designed and developed an innovative automated plant watering system using machine learning techniques. Leveraging Python, the project utilized the Random Forest algorithm from the scikit-learn library to build a predictive model. Historical weather data, obtained through a weather API, served as input to the model. This model forecasts changes in soil moisture levels over the next two weeks based on temperature and precipitation data. An additional Python code interfaced with an Arduino-based watering system, enabling it to dynamically adapt the watering schedule in response to the model's predictions. This project exemplifies the integration of data science and hardware automation for efficient and sustainable plant care.
